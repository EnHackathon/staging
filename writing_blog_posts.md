# Writing EnHackathon blog posts

1. Clone the git repository at https://github.com/EnHackathon/staging locally.

   Make sure you've been added as a collaborator with write permission by Lewis or Alex.

2. To add a new post to the blog, create a new .md file in the _posts directory of your local copy of the repository.

   The filename should be "YYYY-MM-DD-NameSurname.md".

3. Write your blog post:

   1. You must include a set of metadata at the top of the file in a specific format.
      - Copy the format used on one of the existing blog posts - the metadata is the lines between the two "---" lines.

      - Specify the author, date, title, and optionally the email address of the author for the post. This data will be used on the published post and for displaying it on the blog home page.

      - Make sure to keep the "layout: post" piece of metadata.

   2. Write and add formatting to the content of your post using the markdown markup language.

      You can find a cheatsheet for markdown at https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet.

      If you're working in VS Code, you can preview markdown out-of-the-box side-by-side with your writing.

4. When you're satisfied with your post, commit and push it to the master branch of the staging repo.

   Visit https://enhackathon.github.io/staging, the staging area for the blog.

   Check that your new post appears as you expect it to on the front page, and read your post. Check the formatting (and any emojis...) appear as expected. 

   Make any edits you want to your post, and commit and push them.

5. During the EnHackathon, new posts from the staging area of the blog will be released to the main blog regularly.
